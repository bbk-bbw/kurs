 * Fix for components in the same sidebar (e.g., Explorer and TOC)
 *
 * This tells each component inside the left sidebar to:
 * 1. Not shrink when another component expands (flex-shrink: 0).
 * 2. Manage its own scrolling if its content is too tall (overflow-y: auto).
 * 3. Have a maximum height to avoid pushing others out (max-height: 40vh).
